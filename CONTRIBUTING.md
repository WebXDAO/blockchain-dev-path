The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [@vinzvinci](https://github.com/vinzvinci) or in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TSRwqx4K2v).

## 🤔 How can I contribute?

### 💣 Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻, and find related reports. 🔎

Since the new GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible. But you can also **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### 🛠 Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions. 🔎

Since the new GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible. But you can also **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### 🟩 Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through these beginner-friendly issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### 📣 Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible!
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to *50 characters or less*.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at *72 characters*.
- Use the body to explain the *what*, *why*, *vs*, and *how*.
- Reference [issues](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/pulls) liberally after the first line.
- Follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines

## How to Contribute 🚀

- Please create an [issue](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path/issues) before creating a pull request.

## How to make a pull request 🤔

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path) repository. Click on the <a  href="https://github.com/web3community/blockchain-dev-path"><img  src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/30/000000/code-fork.png"/></a> symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/blockchain-dev-path.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd blockchain-dev-path
```

**4.** Create a new branch

Kindly give your branch a more descriptive name like `feat-optimize-images` instead of `patch-1`.

You could follow this convention. Some ideas to get you started:

- Feature Updates: `feat-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- Bug Fixes: `fix-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- Documentation: `docs-<2-3-Words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- And so on...

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

**5.** Make the necessary changes.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit.

```bash
git add . # Stages all the changes
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```
*Follow our commit guide from above*

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**8.** Create a new [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from `your-branch-name`

**9.** 🎉 Congratulations! You've made your first pull request! Now, you should just wait until the maintainers review your pull request.

## 🌳 Hacktoberfest Guidelines

### ✅ Good Practice

- Comment on the issue to get assigned
- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

### ❌ Bad Practice

- Creating pull requests without issue assignment will not be accepted and will be closed.

**No idea what Hacktoberfest is? Visit their website [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) to know more about the event.**

After this, the project maintainers will review the changes and will merge your PR if they found it good, otherwise we will suggest the required changes.
