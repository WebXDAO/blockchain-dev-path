In this video, you'll learn how to build a full stack NFT marketplace on Ethereum with Solidity, Polygon, IPFS, Next.js, Ethers.js, and Hardhat.

We'll start from scratch, creating a new project and installing the dependencies. We'll then write and test out the smart contracts. Once the tests have passed, we'll write the front end code to connect the smart contracts.

After testing on a local network, we'll deploy to the Matic / Polygon network using a custom RPC provider (Infura).
