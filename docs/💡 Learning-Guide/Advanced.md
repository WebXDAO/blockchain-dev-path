# Advanced
## Understanding Blockchain in a bit higher level than the beginner

An opinionated learning path for getting into speed with Blockchain (specially Ethereum).
## Pre-requisites

Besides a programming background, this path assumes that the reader is at least a little comfortable with:
- Public key cryptography<br/>
   - Watch [Public Key Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4). (Est. time: 7 minutes)
- Digital signatures
   - Read [Cryptography Digital 
       Signitures.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/cryptography_digital_signatures.htm) (Est. time: 10 minutes)
   - Watch [What are Digital Signatures and How Do They Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR4_RBb8A9Q) (Est. time: 3 minutes)
- Cryptographic hashing
   -  Watch [What is Hashing on the Blockchain?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGSB9zoSx70) (Est. time: 5 minutes)

## Blockchain

   1. Watch [Blockchain - A visual demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8) (Est. time: 18 minutes)
