#### What is Stakes.social?

Stakes.social is a platform where you can register your OSS to Dev Protocol and stake registered OSS projects. Unlike other donation services, Dev Protocol is designed for the benefit of both supporters as well as developers by staking. Thanks to this system, developers find it easy to ask people for aid, which results in continuous support.
